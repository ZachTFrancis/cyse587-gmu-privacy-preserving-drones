# Project Theme

How can drone operations be designed to prevent the unintended or deliberate capture of private spaces, such as through windows, while still enabling their intended applications?

# Problem Statement

A key requirement for UTM is ensuring it preserves the privacy of individuals. If this requirement is not accomplished, there will be public backlash that will result in legislation and other restrictions that may make UTM nonviable economically.
